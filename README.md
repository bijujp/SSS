SMART SOLDERING PROJECT

1. Introduction
- I want to make a smart soldering station that could do something smart-ish.
- I follow a project on istyle.kr of a Korean hobby. He was using an AVR and
coding in ASM.
- I use PIC microcontroller instead because I am familiar with PIC micro.
Maybe in the future I will port this project into a STM, because STM microcontrollers
are know for its low price.
